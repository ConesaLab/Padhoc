Evaluators for measuring classifier performance.

Once examples are classified, the correctness of these classifications
can be measured with an Evaluator class. The different Evaluators are 
intended to be used with different types of examples. For example, the
AveragingMultiClassEvaluator can be used to measure multi-class example
classification results.
