[The Mechanism Study on Histone Acetylation Activating Glioblastoma-derived Neurotrophic Factor Transcription].
To study the regulation role and mechanism of protein acetylation on the expression of glioblastoma-derived neurotrophic factor (<i>GDNF</i>) in human glioma.
Six normal brain tissue samples, six low-grade glioma brain tissue (LG-glioma), and six high-grade glioma brain tissue (HG-glioma) were collected for study. Human glioma U251 cells were treated with histone acetylase inhibitor and histone deacetylase inhibition. The mRNA level of <i>GDNF</i> in glioma and normal controls was detected by Real-time PCR. H3K9 acetylation level of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) binding region on GDNF promoter and the ability of CREB combining to <i>GDNF</i> promoter were detected by ChIP-PCR. The effects of histone acetylase and deacetylase inhibitors on transcription factor binding ability and GDNF expression were detected.
The mRNA level of <i>GDNF</i> in HG-glioma was significantly higher than those in normal brain tissue and LG-glioma (<i>P</i> < 0.01). The H3K9 acetylation level of <i>GDNF</i> promoter region in the glioma was increased compared to that in the normal brain tissue (<i>P</i> < 0.01), and the acetylation level in CREB-binding region on the <i>GDNF</i> promoter was higher than that in the non-CREB-binding region (<i>P</i> < 0.01). The binding activity of CREB and <i>GDNF</i> promoter in HG-glioma was higher than those in normal brain tissue and LG-glioma (<i>P</i> < 0.05). After treatment of U251 cells with histone acetyltransferase inhibition, the level of acetylation in CREB-binding region on <i>GDNF</i> promoter, the binding activity of CREB and <i>GDNF</i> promoter was decreased, and <i>GDNF</i> transcription and expression were down-regulated, while histone deacetylase inhibitors had the opposite effect (<i>P</i> < 0.01).
Histone acetylation promotes the transcription expression of <i>GDNF</i> in glioma by promoting the binding of transcription factor CREB to the promoter region of GDNF gene.
